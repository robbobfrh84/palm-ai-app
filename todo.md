# Raw notes

### Replace seems to work
- "replace any output that is black with orange."

### So, so adding no-white-no-black to the prompt seems to work
- `zebra-no-white-no-black`

### Enhancement Idea
- Train the modely to have primary, secondary, and terinary colors.  

### Using words not allowed
- `npm start asian` > "ivory, lightskin"
- problem right there, AND lightskin is not an option... So we need to do an options check.
  - I think if ANY word isn't in our colors, we just show an error.
